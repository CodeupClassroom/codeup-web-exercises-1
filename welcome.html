<!--Part One
For this exercise, we will continue working in the welcome.html file. We will be creating a landing page for the fictional company Veridian Dynamics.
Recreate this image with HTML, focusing only in the HTML elements necessary to have a good structure.

Specifications:
Make sure the text in the tag line below the heading at the top is properly bolded and italicized.
The pricing plan at the bottom is a table.
The link at the bottom of the page should take you to the top of the page when clicked.
Use semantic elements for the layout.
You can obtain free stock photos to work with from pexels.
