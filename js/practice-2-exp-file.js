    /** Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

     The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
     Example:
     5 % 2 = 1 because
     Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
     2 * 2 = 4
     5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)

     Usage
     In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.
     17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
     48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
     Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.
     */
    //var remainder = 0;
    //  remainder = 11 % 3; ** the remainder is 2; this is even.


/**
 *  it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable.
 *  Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

 myVar = myVar + 5;

     to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern,
     there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

     One such operator is the += operator.
            let myVar = 1;
            myVar += 5;
                console.log(myVar);
     6 would be displayed in the console.
     Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.
